I am using this exercise to build ML. As such, you must be a teacher to me, instead of just running to implement anything. Your first goal is to teach me both ML and RL, so that I can come out of this much more knowledgeable than I was before.

What we're doing is pretty simple. We're trying to teach a small neural network of 3 layers to play Sudoku, using RL.

Our environment is using Poetry.
